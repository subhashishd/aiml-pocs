## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2025-08-08

### Added - Comprehensive E2E Testing & Stability Fixes
- ‚ú® **Major Feature**: Migrated frontend testing from Cypress to Playwright for enhanced reliability and cross-browser testing
- ‚ú® **Comprehensive E2E Test Suite**: Recreated full test suite with 25 tests covering:
  - Navigation and Basic UI (homepage, dashboard, responsive design)
  - Full Validation Workflow (file uploads, large files, results display, state management)
  - Backend API Workflow (validation, duplicate detection, health checks, error handling)
- ‚ú® **Cross-browser Testing**: Configured Playwright to run tests on Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, and mobile viewports
- ‚ú® **Global Setup/Teardown**: Implemented global setup for service coordination and test fixture management
- ‚ú® **Enhanced Test Files**: Created comprehensive Excel test files with up to 62 parameters for thorough validation testing

### Changed - Duplicate Detection & Error Handling
- ‚ö° **Major Improvement**: Implemented robust, hash-based duplicate detection in the backend `/validate` endpoint
- Backend now calculates SHA256 hashes of PDF and Excel files to prevent reprocessing
- Returns cached results with a `duplicate_detected` status for existing file combinations
- Stores file hashes in a new `file_hashes` database table for future checks
- Improved API error handling for missing or invalid files

### Fixed - Critical Backend & Frontend Bugs
- üêõ **CRITICAL**: Fixed 500 error in validation workflow caused by `'chunk_text'` key mismatch in `OptimizedMultimodalPDFProcessor`
- üêõ Fixed issue where duplicate files were not being detected and reprocessed unnecessarily
- üêõ Resolved flaky frontend test issues by migrating to Playwright and implementing better test practices:
  - Improved selector strategies for reliability
  - Handling for webpack overlays and asynchronous UI updates
  - Proper timeouts and network handling for improved stability
- üêõ Fixed minor assertion issue in API tests expecting 422 but receiving 400 status for validation errors

### Performance
- ‚ö° Prevents unnecessary reprocessing of duplicate files, saving significant time and resources
- Faster and more reliable E2E test execution with Playwright

### Technical Details & Troubleshooting üîß

#### Backend Issues Fixed:
- **500 Error Fix**: The `OptimizedMultimodalPDFProcessor.py` was using `'text': chunk_text` instead of `'chunk_text': chunk_text` in line 297 of the `_convert_extractions_to_chunks()` method
- **Duplicate Detection**: Added `file_hashes` table with unique index on `(pdf_hash, excel_hash)` for efficient duplicate checking
- **Hash Storage**: File hashes are stored after successful processing with `store_file_hashes(config_id, pdf_hash, excel_hash, pdf_filename, excel_filename)`

#### Playwright Migration Details:
- **Test Files**: All tests moved from `cypress/` to `e2e/` directory structure
- **Configuration**: `playwright.config.js` with cross-browser and mobile testing support
- **Global Setup**: Service coordination in `e2e/global-setup.js` checks frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 8000) readiness
- **Test Fixtures**: PDF and Excel test files copied to `e2e/fixtures/` for reliable test execution
- **Browser Coverage**: Tests run on Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Mobile Chrome, and Mobile Safari
- **Debugging**: Traces, screenshots, and videos captured on test failures for easier debugging

#### Files Modified:
- `fastapi/app/main.py`: Added duplicate detection logic to `/validate` endpoint
- `fastapi/app/services/optimized_multimodal_pdf_processor.py`: Fixed chunk_text key mismatch
- `fastapi/app/models/database.py`: Added `check_duplicate_files()` and `store_file_hashes()` functions
- `frontend/playwright.config.js`: New Playwright configuration
- `frontend/package.json`: Updated test scripts for Playwright
- `frontend/e2e/`: Complete new test suite with navigation, workflow, and API tests

#### Database Schema Changes:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS file_hashes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    config_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    pdf_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    excel_hash TEXT NOT NULL, 
    pdf_filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    excel_filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS file_hashes_unique_idx ON file_hashes (pdf_hash, excel_hash);
```
