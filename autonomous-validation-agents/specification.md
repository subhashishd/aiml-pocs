# Autonomous Multi-Agent System - Dynamic Memory Management Specification

## Overview
This document outlines an autonomous, multi-agent system with intelligent memory management that dynamically spawns and consolidates agents based on available resources. The system adapts its architecture in real-time to optimize performance within memory constraints.

## Current System Context
The existing system (POC #1) requires users to:
1. Upload Excel and PDF files
2. Click "Create Embeddings" to extract and vectorize PDF content
3. Click "Validate" to compare Excel parameters against PDF data

The new system (POC #2) will automate this entire workflow through intelligent agent coordination with adaptive resource management.

## Core Innovation: Dynamic Agent Management

### Memory-Aware Agent Spawning
- **Resource Monitoring:** Continuous memory usage tracking
- **Dynamic Spawning:** Create sub-agents only when memory permits
- **Role Consolidation:** Single agents can assume multiple roles when resources are limited
- **Graceful Degradation:** System maintains functionality even with minimal agent count

## System Objectives
1. **Autonomous Operation:** Single file upload triggers complete validation workflow via a web application interface
2. **Comprehensive Frontend Integration:** User-friendly web interface for uploading files, monitoring progress, and viewing results, ensuring seamless user experience across devices
3. **Adaptive Resource Management:** Dynamic agent spawning based on memory availability
3. **Intelligent Role Consolidation:** Agents can combine multiple capabilities when needed
4. **Local Efficiency:** Optimized for 8GB RAM with 16GB scalability
5. **Precision Validation:** Exact matching for numerical values, semantic for text

### Memory Monitoring
```python
class MemoryManager:
    def __init__(self, max_memory_gb=8):
        self.max_memory = max_memory_gb * 1024 * 1024 * 1024  # Convert to bytes
        self.safety_margin = 0.15  # 15% safety buffer
        self.agent_memory_map = {}
        
    def can_spawn_agent(self, agent_type, estimated_memory):
        current_usage = self.get_current_memory_usage()
        available = self.max_memory * (1 - self.safety_margin) - current_usage
        return available >= estimated_memory
        
    def suggest_consolidation(self):
        # Logic to identify which agents can be consolidated
        pass
```

### Dynamic Agent Spawning Logic
1. **Memory Assessment:** Check available memory before spawning
2. **Priority-Based Spawning:** Critical agents first, optimization agents last
3. **Capability Inheritance:** Parent agents can absorb child capabilities
4. **Graceful Fallback:** System functions with minimum viable agent set

### Agent Consolidation Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Document Processing Consolidation
- **High Memory:** PDF Agent + Excel Agent + Validation Agent
- **Medium Memory:** Document Processing Agent (PDF + Excel) + Validation Agent
- **Low Memory:** Orchestrator Agent handles all processing

#### Pattern 2: Processing-Validation Consolidation
- **High Memory:** Specialized processing agents + Validation Agent with sub-agents
- **Medium Memory:** Processing agents + Integrated validation
- **Low Memory:** Single agent with sequential processing

#### Pattern 3: Sub-agent Absorption
- **High Memory:** Main agents with specialized sub-agents
- **Medium Memory:** Main agents with internal sub-capabilities
- **Low Memory:** Single multi-capability agent

## Resource-Aware Decision Making

### Memory Threshold Levels
- **High (>6GB available):** Full agent ecosystem with sub-agents
- **Medium (3-6GB available):** Core agents with selective sub-agent spawning
- **Low (1-3GB available):** Consolidated agents with minimal sub-agents
- **Critical (<1GB available):** Single orchestrator with sequential processing

### Dynamic Capability Assignment
```python
class AdaptiveAgent:
    def __init__(self, base_capabilities):
        self.base_capabilities = base_capabilities
        self.absorbed_capabilities = []
        
    def absorb_capability(self, capability, memory_constraint):
        if self.can_handle_additional_load(capability, memory_constraint):
            self.absorbed_capabilities.append(capability)
            return True
        return False
        
    def delegate_or_execute(self, task):
        if self.should_delegate(task) and self.can_spawn_sub_agent():
            return self.delegate_to_sub_agent(task)
        else:
            return self.execute_internally(task)
```
