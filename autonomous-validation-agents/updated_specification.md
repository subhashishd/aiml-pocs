# Updated Specification for Autonomous Validation Agents

## Overview
This document outlines the advanced architecture and implementation strategy for a .NET-based autonomous validation system using Microsoft Orleans and Semantic Kernel. This system leverages intelligent multi-agent orchestration, local model inference, and adaptive memory management for validating Excel and PDF files in resource-constrained environments.

## Key Innovations
- **Semantic Kernel Integration**: Optimized for AI orchestration, using SK agents collocated with Orleans grains.
- **Hybrid Model Utilization**: Leveraging ONNX for .NET and Python-based microservices for flexible ML inference.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Adaptive agent spawning and capability consolidation based on available resources.
  
## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Orchestrator Grain**
   - Manages the entire workflow, coordinates between Excel and PDF grains, and adapts operation modes based on memory conditions and resource availability.
   
2. **PDF Intelligence Grain**
   - Processes PDF documents using multimodal ML models.
   - Integrates BLIP and OCR for content extraction and multimodal understanding.

3. **Excel Intelligence Grain**
   - Extracts, analyzes, and validates Excel parameters, ensuring alignment with PDF content.

4. **Validation Grain**
   - Executes semantic and exact matching operations, integrating .NET ML models and SK agents where applicable.

### Multi-Environment Deployment
- **Development Config (MacBook, 8GB RAM)**: Memory-optimized with low-memory SK settings and local model inference.
- **Production Config (Oracle VM, 24GB RAM)**: Full-scale SK capabilities with complete multimodal processing.

### Memory-Aware Orchestration
- **High Memory Mode (>6GB free)**: Full deployment with fine-grained sub-agents and SK orchestration.
- **Medium Memory Mode (3-6GB free)**: Core grains with selective role delegation and simplified SK models.
- **Low Memory Mode (1-3GB free)**: Consolidated grains handling with basic inference.

## Key Functionalities and Strategies
- **Lazy Model Loading**: Implements deferred loading for models based on immediate execution requirements.
- **Memory Efficient Attention**: Applies attention optimization in transformers to reduce resource footprint.
- **Sub-Agent Logic**: Enables spawning of temporary sub-agents under specific memory thresholds.

## Agent Communication and Lifecycle
- **In-Memory Messaging**: Utilizes structured JSON for lightweight inter-grain communication.
- **Dynamic Agent Consolidation**: Handles both role absorption and task delegation in real-time, ensuring optimal operation within constraints.

## Learning and Adaptation
- **Performance Tracking**: Continuously monitors task efficiency and adapts strategy based on historical success in similar scenarios.
- **Adaptive Resource Management**: Shifts allocation based on learned resource utilization patterns, optimizing memory footprint progressively.

## Technical Implementation
- **Semantic Kernel Agents**: Collocated with Orleans grains, SK agents handle orchestrated AI tasks with fallback to local models.
- **Python Microservices**: Handle more complex ML inference tasks not supported directly by .NET, using HTTP/gRPC integration for cross-compatibility.

## Success Metrics
- **Adaptability**: Seamless operation across varying resource configurations.
- **Precision**: High accuracy in validation tasks, ensuring numerical and semantic integrity.
- **Resilience**: Robust handling of resource limitations without critical task failure.

## Implementation Roadmap
1. **Prototype Development (3 weeks)**: Establish basic .NET and Orleans structure, leveraging existing Python POC for reference.
2. **Integration Phase (4 weeks)**: Develop cross-platform communications, integrate SK and Python services, and validate functionality.
3. **Optimization and Testing (3 weeks)**: Optimize memory management, validate performance across configurations, and refine SK configurations.
