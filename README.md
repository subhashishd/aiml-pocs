## Development Guidelines

### Version Control
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, etc.
- Create feature branches: `feature/project-name/feature-description`
- Each project maintains its own CHANGELOG.md

### Testing
- Each project should have comprehensive test coverage
- Run tests before committing: `npm test` or `pytest`
- E2E tests should be included for user-facing features

### Documentation
- Keep project-specific README.md files updated
- Document API changes and breaking changes in CHANGELOG.md
- Include setup and usage instructions
